# Project 4 -  Photo-Scavenger-Hunt

Submitted by: Efrain Rodriguez

Photo Scavenger Hunt is an app that displays a list of interest that will become as task when user clicks any of the cells. When user clicks a cell, a new view with a map view and an attach photo button will then be part of that second view. If user attachs a photo, the map will then direct to the latitude and longitude of where the picture was taken. When user completes this step, the circle inset will then change color and the task for the photo hunt will be completed.

Time spent: 10 hours in total.
